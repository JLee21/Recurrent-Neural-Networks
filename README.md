# Recurrent-Neural-Networks
My own attempt of wrapping my mind around RNNs.

## Ultimate Goals
* To create a RNN agent that can play a game, like Tic-Tac-Toe
* To be able to teach the concept of RNNs to the point where one can implemnt in just Python's Numpy
* To provide the learning steps I took in learning RNNs (with a background in basic NN, CNNs, classification, regression).

## First Phase
Andrej Karpathy's Stanford Lecture **CS231n Winter 2016 Lecture 10 Recurrent Neural Networks, Image Captioning, LSTM** (sorry, the YouTube link is private and I'm personally allowed to share it).
I'm going through the Stanford lecture and parsing the lecture at my own pace. I'm creating a notebook that elaborates [Andrej's barebones implementation](https://gist.github.com/karpathy/d4dee566867f8291f086) of a RNN. My implementation is a notebook `min-char-rnn`.
